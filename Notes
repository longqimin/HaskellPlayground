a module imported was found in multiple packages: both in packageA and packageB?

there are 3 ways to solve it:
1. ghc-pkg hide packageA.
This will cause GHC and GHCi to ignore the presence of the packageA by default until you later ghc-pkg expose ModuelA, but software installed by Cabal will still be able to build against it.

2.Use the {-# LANGUAGE PackageImports #-} pragma, and change your import statement to import "packageB".

3.Use Cabal to build your project, and specify packageB in the Build-depends line.
